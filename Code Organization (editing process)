# Task

mostly used for multi-task  

- `static` because
- `final` because 

There are often values that are inserted into the code and might need to be adjusted later. For instance:

```java
turnLeft();
wait(1.5);
moveForward();
```

```java
if (distance >= 5 && distance <= 10) {
    // ...
}
```

The numbers can be moved to [the top of the class](structure.md#order-of-declarations-in-classes) and declared as constants, since they should not be changed when the program is running.

```java
public class SomeClass {

    private static final double DELAY_AFTER_TURN = 1.5;
    private static final int MIN_DISTANCE = 5;
    private static final int MAX_DISTANCE = 10;
```

```java
turnLeft();
wait(DELAY_AFTER_TURN);
moveForward();
```
